Nested Ranges Check -- algorithm seems fine but when i made a python version it didn't work
Nested Ranges Count -- skip
8/5/23:
Room Allocation -- cpp diff
Factory Machines -- binary search :)
Tasks and Deadlines -- simple theorem
Reading Books -- "ayy logic for the win!"
Sum of Three Values -- happy to see i was able to get to the solution quicker this time!
Sum of Four Values -- 24/26 :/ yeah, not sure how meet in the middle works yet
8/6/23:
Nearest Smaller Values -- had to look up the solution, implementation was simple
Subarray Sums I -- standard 2 pointer approach
Subarray Sums II -- had to skip, one tc off :/
Subarray Divisibility -- grr, skip/one tc off on this as well
Subarray Distinct Values -- I think I've seen this on CF Edu before
Array Division -- binary search :)
Sliding Median -- skip :/, which means sliding cost is also a skip since it uses the median
Movie Festival II -- once again, sorted set is required *rolls eyes*, cpp version works!
Maximum Subarray Sum II -- last one!!, ver. 1 but with 2P
