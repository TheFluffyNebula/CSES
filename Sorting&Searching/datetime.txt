Note: if there is a cpp solution it means i failed to solve it/get a solution in python

8/2/23:
Apartments -- i forgot how to check for bounds

Ferris Wheel -- I'm surprised this worked :o

I still haven't seen a working python solution to concert tickets
Restaurant Customers -- improved over my interval solution 5mo ago by a lot :D
Movie Festival -- Classic Greedy
Sum of Two Values -- Classic Two Pointers
Maximum Subarray Sum -- tricky prefix maneuvers
Stick Lengths -- pretty easy
Missing Coin Sum -- cool problem, prefix sum :o

Collecting Numbers 2 -- I got too lost :(

Playlist -- similar but not the same as segment of small sets in CF Edu (2P)
had a bit of trouble moving the left pointer
Towers -- had to look at an older solution but was able to recreate the idea mostly by myself this time
Traffic Lights -- another impossible via python due to cpp sorted sets
Josephus Problem 1 -- I had to look this up but I'm glad I did
Josephus Problem 2 -- looks like you can't brute force this one, TLE for now
