5/22/24: Attempting Chessboard and Queens using CSES Handbook, Backtracking

Chessboard of Queens and Grid Paths seem difficult for now
5/17/25: now that I think about it, chessboard & grid paths are probably both backtracking problem
I have the pseudocode for a generic backtracking algorithm, now I just have to try it
oops, extremely inefficient and incorrect version
had to chatgpt the solution but hopefully I should be able to try grid paths by myself
hmm... not fast enough (I'll try cleaning it first when I get the chance)
